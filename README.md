Introduction
--
This work is published on Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (TDSC), 2016. 

We first propose a JPEG encryption algorithm, which  enciphers an image to a smaller size and keeps the format compliant to JPEG decoder. It outperforms a previous work in terms of separation capability, embedding capacity and security.
